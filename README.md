# Lotofacil Web

This repository has been repurposed to focus on building a modern, responsive website rather than an Android application. Below is an outlined guide on the new project architecture and features:

---

## Project Overview:
The pivot shifts away from Android development to web technologies that allow flexible, dynamic user experiences. The core features, including statistical analysis, number generators, and dashboards, will migrate to a web-based approach while preserving the original intentions behind their functionalities.

## Updated Architecture Stack:
- **Frontend:**
  - Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), enabling server-side rendering and React-based development.
  - UI: [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), ensuring modern appearance and responsive design.

- **Backend:**
  - Framework: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), chosen for high performance and robust API schema definitions.
  - Database: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), for storing user statistics, generated results, and related data.

- **Server Architecture:**
  - Hosting: Deployment-ready for Virtual Private Server (VPS) providers.
  - Proxy Services: Integration with [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) or [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/) for smooth traffic routing.
  
- **Deployment Flow:**
  - CI/CD pipelines highlighting GitHub Actions for build-test-deploy automation flows.
  - VPS env setup script—using Dockerized services or directly produced with RPM flavors.

## User-Driven Functionalities:
- **Statistical Analysis**: Transformed & rendered via dashboards adaptable to web user experience flow.
- **Number Generator Enhancement**—REST-conforming web endpoint protocols API leadership augmentations.
Tech Context ROOT RELEASE perspective runtime shared embracing—same-sp spectral souls-wave.
